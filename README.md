# Logistics Optimization React Application

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a React application aimed at enhancing logistics operations. The application will manage products, containers, trucks, drivers, and admins to optimize the organization and movement of goods. A key feature will be a map view that displays real-time truck locations, showing details for one truck at a time. Initially, the application will use static data and manual data entry, with future plans to integrate IoT systems for automatic data collection. The application will be deployed on Vercel.

### 5. Admin Features
- **Roles and Permissions:**
  - Admins manage users, access all data, and configure system settings.
  - Different admin roles with varying access levels can be defined.
- **Functions:** Includes user management, system configuration, and data oversight.

### 6. Map View
- **Features:**
  - Real-time tracking of truck locations with latitude and longitude.
  - Users can select which truck’s location is visible on the map.
  - Future updates may include route planning and historical data visualization.
- **Interaction:** The map displays only one truck’s details at a time.

## Static Data and Manual Data Entry

### 1. Static Data
- **Sources:** Data will be stored in local JSON files during development.
- **Structure:** Static data includes products, containers, trucks, and drivers.
- **Updates:** Manual updates will be made during development.
